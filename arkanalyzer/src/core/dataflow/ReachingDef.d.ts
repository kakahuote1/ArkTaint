/**
 * Reaching Definitions Data Flow Analysis
 *
 * This module implements the Reaching Definitions data flow analysis algorithm.
 * Reaching Definitions is a forward data flow analysis that determines, for each
 * program point, the set of variable definitions (assignments) that may reach
 * that point without being overwritten.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * 1. **Transfer Function**:
 *    - Computes the out set for each node based on its in set.
 *    - Uses gen and kill sets to model the effects of assignments:
 *      - **gen**: The set of definitions generated by the current node.
 *      - **kill**: The set of definitions killed (overwritten) by the current node.
 *
 * 2. **Meet Operation**:
 *    - Combines data flow values from multiple paths (e.g., union for reaching definitions).
 *    - Ensures that the analysis is conservative (safe) by over-approximating the result.
 *
 *  The analysis is forward, meaning it propagates information from predecessors to successors.
