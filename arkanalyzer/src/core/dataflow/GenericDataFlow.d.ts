/**
 * Generic Data Flow Analysis Framework
 *
 * This module provides a generic framework for implementing data flow analyses,
 * such as Reaching Definitions, Live Variables, and Available Expressions.
 * The framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to
 * define custom flow graphs, transfer functions, and meet operations.
 *
 * Design Notes:
 * - The framework is designed to be generic and reusable, allowing users to
 *   implement custom data flow analyses by defining appropriate transfer functions
 *   and meet operations.
 * - The solver uses a worklist algorithm to efficiently compute the MFP solution.
 * - The analysis can be configured as either forward or backward, depending on
 *   the problem requirements.
 *
